# Save Your Code – 7-Day Git Challenge 🚀

Welcome to **Save Your Code**!  
This repo is the official home for all tasks, resources, and sample files for our **7-day Git learning challenge**.

## 🧠 What This Is
A practical, beginner-friendly way to learn:
- How to save your code using Git (`add`, `commit`)
- How to share it safely on GitHub (`push`, `pull`)
- How to see your work history (`status`, `log`)
- How to collaborate with others (without breaking everything!)

No boring lectures — just clear daily tasks you can follow at your own pace.

## 📅 Roadmap & Structure

### 🔑 Orientation (Before Day 0)
Happens outside this repo — usually in the WhatsApp group.
- Welcome participants & explain how the challenge works  
- Share this repo link & tell them to check back daily  
- Encourage them to ask questions & help each other  
- Set expectations: no certificates, no deadlines, just learning  

---

### 🖥️ Day 0 – Setup & Terminal Basics
Goal: Get your environment ready.
- Install **Git**  
- Install **VS Code** (or any text editor)  
- Create a **GitHub account**  
- Learn terminal basics:  
  - `pwd` (where am I?)  
  - `ls` / `dir` (see what’s inside a folder)  
  - `cd` (move between folders)  
  - `mkdir` (make a folder)  

This is the *prep day* — before we do any real Git work.

---

### 📄 Day 1 – Your First Git Repo
Goal: Start using Git for real.
- Create a new folder  
- Run `git init` to make it a repo  
- Create a file (`hello.txt`)  
- Stage it (`git add`)  
- Commit it (`git commit -m "my first commit"`)  
- Learn what a commit is & why it’s important  

---

### 📄 Day 2 – Tracking Changes
Goal: Practice saving your work.
- Edit your file & commit again  
- Learn `git status` to check what changed  
- Learn `git log` to see your history  

---

### 🌍 Day 3 – Connect to GitHub
Goal: Move your local repo online.
- Create a GitHub repo  
- Link your local repo (`git remote add origin ...`)  
- Push to GitHub (`git push -u origin main`)  
- Celebrate your first repo in the cloud 🎉  

---

### 🔄 Day 4 – Pulling & Updating
Goal: Learn to stay in sync with the cloud.
- Edit file on GitHub directly  
- Pull changes to your computer (`git pull`)  
- See how local + remote stay connected  

---

### 🌱 Day 5 – Branching Basics
Goal: Learn to work without breaking the main code.
- Create a new branch (`git branch`, `git checkout -b feature-1`)  
- Make changes & commit  
- Merge back into main (`git merge feature-1`)  

---

### 🤝 Day 6 – Team Simulation
Goal: Work together in one repo.
- Everyone adds their name in `participants/` as `yourname.txt`  
- Commit & push  
- Pull updates from others  
- Learn what happens when two people edit the same file (merge conflicts)  

---

### 🚀 Day 7 – Wrap Up & Final Push
Goal: Put it all together.
- Everyone does a final push  
- Celebrate having a shared repo with everyone’s contributions  
- Quick reflection: what was hardest? what was easiest?  
- Optional: small group project (bonus)

---

## 🏁 Goal
By the end of this challenge you will:
- Have your own public GitHub repo
- Know how to save and share code like a pro
- Be comfortable working with others on the same project

💡 **Pro tip:** This repo will grow each day — check back regularly for updates!
