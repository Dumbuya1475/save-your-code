# Save Your Code – 7-Day Git Challenge 🚀

Welcome to **Save Your Code**!  
This repo is the official home for all tasks, resources, and sample files for our **7-day Git learning challenge**.

## 🧠 What This Is
A practical, beginner-friendly way to learn:
- How to save your code using Git (`add`, `commit`)
- How to share it safely on GitHub (`push`, `pull`)
- How to see your work history (`status`, `log`)
- Basic collaboration skills without chaos

No lectures, no pressure — just daily step-by-step tasks you can follow at your own pace.

## 📅 Structure
Each day has its own folder:
- `day-0/` → Basic terminal commands (`cd`, `mkdir`, `ls/dir`)
- `day-1/` → Installing Git + Setting up your first repo
- `day-2/` → `git add` + `git commit`
- `day-3/` → Connecting to GitHub + `git push`
- `day-4/` → Pulling updates + working with changes
- `day-5/` → Branching basics + collaboration tips
- `day-6/` → Review + final project

📄 Each folder will contain:
- A **PDF guide** with step-by-step instructions  
- Example files (when needed)

## 🏁 Goal
By the end of 7 days you will:
- Have your own public GitHub repo
- Know how to save and share code like a pro
- Be ready to collaborate with other developers confidently
